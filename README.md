# Micro-ROS on Raspberry Pi Pico for Rover Freya drill

## Introduction
This project demonstrates the integration of Micro-ROS on a Raspberry Pi Pico, serving as the central microcontroller 
in a drill system of our rover Freya. The Pico manages communication with subsystems responsible for controlling linear 
motors, the drilling motor, and storage system via I2C. It acts as a lightweight, efficient, and reliable control unit, enabling 
seamless coordination of these components.

## Features
- Integration of Micro-ROS on Raspberry Pi Pico.
- USB or UART communication with Mars Rover.
- I2C communication with peripherals.
- Joy subscriber.
- Publishes weight of the sample.

## Hardware Requirements
- Drill motherboard with components
- Drill motors and actuators
- Power suppply 24V

## Software Requirements
- Pico SDK C/C++
- ROS 2
- joy package from joystick_drivers repo
