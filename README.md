# Micro-ROS on Raspberry Pi Pico for Rover Freya drill

## Introduction
This project demonstrates the integration of Micro-ROS on a Raspberry Pi Pico, serving as the central microcontroller 
in a drill system of our rover Freya. The Pico manages communication with subsystems responsible for controlling linear 
motors, the drilling motor, and storage system via I2C. It acts as a lightweight, efficient, and reliable control unit, enabling 
seamless coordination of these components.

## Features

    - Integration of Micro-ROS on Raspberry Pi Pico.
    - USB or UART communication with Mars Rover.
    - I2C communication with peripherals.
    - Joy subscriber.
    - Publishes weight of the sample.

## Hardware Requirements

    - Drill motherboard with components
    - Drill motors and actuators
    - Power suppply 24V

## Software Requirements

    - Pico SDK C/C++
    - ROS 2
    - joy package from joystick_drivers repo
    - Micro-ROS
    - Micro-ROS agent (or using docker)
